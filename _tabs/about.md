# Profile

- I am [Raahul Dutta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raahuldutta/), a Machine Learning Professional with 8+ years of experience in transforming the
Jupyter Notebooks into low-latency, highly scalable - production standard endpoints,
I implemented various ML/AI models and pipelines (30+) and exposed them.

- I am skilled in implementing ML Training and Deployment Pipeline and
Recommendation Engine(Offline and Online), NLP, Transfer Learning, TinyML along
with various programming languages (Python, C#, Rust). Well-versed in working across
interdisciplinary teams with quality assured on-time delivery.

- I am now leading the MLOPs team in Elsevier, and am building an MLOps orchestration
tool that enables Data Scientists to ship the trained model into production.

- I built the recommendation engine of the [Nutriu](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.ka.oneka.app&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) App that is used by millions of users across the globe.
